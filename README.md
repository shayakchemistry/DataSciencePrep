# Prep Work for Data Science interviews

## Introduction

This document is to help us prepare for Data Science interviews. Not all the topics might needed for the role but will give a holistic picture of the related technologies. The following topics are going to be covered:

1. Algorithm Design
2. Java
3. Apache Spark
4. Python (more from language perspective)
5. R (more from language perspective)
6. Statistics
7. Data Science (from machine learning perspective)
8. Natural Language Processing

The motive is to build a in-depth knowledge base and to cover up almost all the topics. Each topic will have it's own repository and will mostly use notebooks as it is much more handy to view and run them. Please let us know if we are missing something.

## Algorithm Design

In this section, we discuss some necessary data structure and algorithm that is required. This topic is covered in the following repository:
