# Python Project

In this module we will explore the key concepts of python. We are going to focus on the following topics:

 - Object types and Operations
 - Iterators and Comprehensions
 - OOPS concepts
 - Modules
 - Functions
 - Exception Handling
 
We have collated information for each of these above mentioned topics in an computational interactive jupyter notebooks.
