    "# NonLocal variable\n",
    "The use of nonlocal keyword is very much similar to the global keyword. nonlocal is used to declare that a variable inside a nested function (function inside a function) is not local to it, meaning it lies in the outer inclosing function. If we need to modify the value of a non-local variable inside a nested function, then we must declare it with nonlocal. Otherwise a local variable with that name is created inside the nested function. Following example will help us clarify this."
