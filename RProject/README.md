## R Project

In this module we will explore the basics concepts of R. We will not get into in depth into topics as it will be covered with other modules. We are going to focus on the following topics:

- Core Programming Concepts
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Data Frames
- Visualization with GGPLOT2
- Advanced R Programming

### Core Programming

In this section we mostly discuss the basics of R programming. We first start with data types in R and then go for logical operators in R and other commonly used programming concepts. They are all discussed in the following subsections.

##### Data Types in R




##### Set Operations


##### Looping in R


##### Beak while repeat


##### "IF" and "ELSE" Statements

##### Memory pre-allocation tactics

##### Why Dates cant just be strings

##### Date operations

#####Working with lubridate and anytime
